    information:"This Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the inner workings of complex algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step processes. It provides a hands-on way to explore and learn about several types of algorithms, including sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, as well as essential graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). \n I Hope you find this helpful in understanding the working of several algorithms ",
