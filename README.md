### Description

This project is made with React and P5JS.

The purpose of doing this was to learn to make animations and at the same time strengthen the knowledge of some classic algorithms.

It is expected to be able to add more animations and at the same time demonstrations of algorithms or curious algorithms, there will not only be visualizations there will also be abstract content.
